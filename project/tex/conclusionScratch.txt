We have derived a time-varying, Bayesian model for inferring the structure of a sequence of Gaussian graphical models. By running this model on synthetic data, for which we have ground-truth, we have shown that our model outperforms a static equivalent. We have also demonstrated our model on multiple real-life datasets in order to show its ability to infer network structure in the fields of both finance and genetics. We hope that pursuing Gaussian graphical model learning in a Bayesian setting will allow for flexible specification of dependencies, especially of the dynamics of time-varying graphs.
